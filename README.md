# Angular Todo
This is a sample project I put together to learn the ropes of [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org).  Ready to conquer some tasks?  It's based on the excellent AngularJS seed repo.

## Setup Instructions

* `git clone git@github.com:danielberkompas/angular-todo.git`, or fork the project and clone your copy.
* Install node and npm.  On Mac, the easiest way is `brew install node`.
* Run `./scripts/web-server.js` to start a basic node webserver to serve the app.
* Navigate to app/index.html.
